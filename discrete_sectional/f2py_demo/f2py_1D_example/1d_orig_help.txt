5. PURPOSE: 1D FDM/RRT/DFT

         FDM = Filter Diagonalization Method
         RRT = Regularized Resolvent Transform
         DFT = Discrete Fourier Transform

6. GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

 The program is based on the FDM and RRT algorithms for high resolution
 spectral analysis of time domain signals. See references for details.
 Given a signal c(n) = C(t0+tau*n) n=0, 1, ..., Nsig, calculate the
 line list {w_k, d_k} and/or the complex spectrum F(w) by fitting c(n)
 to the Auto-Regressive (AR) model,

            c(n) = sum_k d_k exp(-i n w_k)        (1)

 where, w_k is the complex frequency (line position & width)
       d_k is the complex amplitude 30482(phase & intregral)

 1) in FDM, the complex spectrum is computed using the formula,

            F(w) = sum_k d_k/(w-w_k+i*Gamm)       (2)

    in RRT, it is estimated as,

            F(w) ~ Cv 1/R(w) Cv'                    (3)

 2). QZ-algorithm is applied to solve the generalized eigenvalue
 problem. ZGESV routine from LAPACK is used to invert matrix R(w).

7. INPUTS:

 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND SOME BASIC IDEAS OF FDM/RRT
 IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF SOME INPUTS SUCH AS BASIS
 SIZE, BASIS DENSITY. IN SUMMARY, FDM/RRT PROCESS THE TIME SIGNAL
 BY DIVIDING THE WHOLE NYQUIST RANGE INTO ONE OR SEVERAL LOCAL
 WINDOWS IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN.

 signal: input data file with appropriate first line. The data
         file is assumed to contain an ASCII formatted list of
         c(n\tau). The first line must be as following:

          dim { NSigmax tau }_[1,..,dim] {idat}_[1,...,dim]

         where dim    : the dimension of the signal (dim=1, 2, ...)
               Nsigmax: the maximum signal length
               tau    : time step (acquistion inteval)
               idat   : data format along each dimension
          e.g/ 1D example: 1 1024 0.001 1
               2D example: 2 2024 0.001 128 0.0001 1 1

         Note: 'idat' implies the data tormat. In 1D, it is defined
         as following:
                idat>0 read real signal, idat<0 read complex signal
                |idat| = 1 read c_n
                |idat| = 2 read t_n,c_n

 t0    : 1st order (i.e., linear) phase correction (in seconds)
         NOTE: t0 is not used in this code.
 theta : zero order (overall) phase correction
 method: method used to compute the spectra: FDM, RRT, or DFT
 Nsig  : number of data points to be used in computing the spectra.
         It will be automatically reduced to Nsigmax (maximum length)
         if specified Nsig is greater than Nsigmax.
 wmino : (see wmaxo)
 wmaxo : specify the frequency range of the spectra to be computed.
         It might be adjusted to fit harmonically with the basis size
         specified (see Nb0, rho) and to fit in the Nyquist Range.

 threshhold: see par below.
 par   : file where the linelist will be written (FDM only).
         Only those with |d(k)| > threshhold will be output.
 ReSp  : file where Re[F(w)] will be written
 ImSp  : file where Im[F(w)] will be written
 AbsSp : file where Abs[F(w)] will be written
         NOTE: if file name is specified as 'none' or 'None', no
               corresponding output will be written.

 rho   : basis density (default = 1.1). rho > 1.0 means putting
         more basis functions than default. For example, rho=1.1
         means putting 10% more basis functions then default.
         rho should not be less than 1.0. rho = 1.5 should be
         considered as the maximum. For typical data, rho = 1.1-1.2
         will usually work the best. if rho < 0, default is used.
 Nb0   : number of narrow band Fourier basis functions used per
         window (see references). Typical value is about 50-300.
         Large Nb0 means bigger spectral range per window. The result
         might be more stable but the calculation will be slower for
         larger Nb0. Except for very long signal (say, Nsig > 10,000),
         Nb0 = 150 will be a good choice.
 Nbc   : number of broad band Fourier basis functions (coarse basis).
         See second reference for more details. Nbc <= 0 means no
         coarse basis. Adding coarse basis (Nbc>0) will usually give
         stabler results and more accurate linelist, especially when
         the signal is noisy or contains non-localized features such
         as broad lines, backgrounds. Typical Nbc = 10 ~ 50. A good
         choice could be Nbc = 20.

 Nsp   : number of points used in plotting the spectra. Defines the
         digital resolution of output spectra.
 Gamm  : smoothing parameter. Defines the smallest possible linewidth.
         Default Gamm = 0.2 * 1/(N*tau). FDM/RRT might give some very
         narrow lines (spikes) due to noise. A non-zero Gamm will
         improve the looking of resulted spectra. if Gamm < 0, default
         will be used.
 cheat : multiply all widths by cheat (FDM only).
         NOTE: be very careful to use cheat < 1.0. It might lead to
               very misleading results. Use cheat=1.0 only.
 cheatmore: if is .true. F(w) is computed with Im d_k (FDM only).
         NOTE: be very careful again. Default: cheatmore = .false.

 ros   : regularization parameter (RRT only). If ros < = 0, no
         regularization in RRT. See 3rd reference for more details.
         In general, bigger ros means more 'regularization', and will
         lead to more stable result but will lower resolution.
         Qualitively, ros is related to the amount of noise present
         in the signal. Noisy data requires bigger regularization.
         For typical NMR signals with fine S/N (say, 500M magnet,
         1 mM sample, normal probe, 4-16 scans), ros = 1d-6 should
         a good guess. If you see artifacts (very easy to tell if
         you know what a typical NMR peak will look like), increase
         ros (say, double the value) and run again. If the spectrum
         look very clean but the resolution is very poor, it may
         indicate too big regularization. Decrease ros and run again.
         NOTE: Choosing an optimal value for ros is a try-and-error
               game. Typically, there will be a flat regime where
               the spectra remains similar even changing ros by order
               of a magnitude. Try following:

                         too many artifacts
             ros=1d-6---------------  ros = ros*10 = 1d-5 --> cont.
                       | clean, but low res.
                       -------------  ros = ros/10 = 1d-7 --> cont.
                       | GREAT!
                       --------- done!

 NB: note that the way the parameter format has been changed for
     the Python version.  See the file 'fd_rrt1d.config' for the
	 new format.
